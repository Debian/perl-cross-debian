    <title>DESCRIPTION</title>
    <para><command>&dhpackage;</command> supports the long term maintenance
    of cross-build support for the Debian configuration of perl.</para>
    <para><command>&dhpackage;</command> assists in the producuction of
    config files from the current perl build tree to update existing
    perl-cross-debian support.

    <title>Updating cross config files</title>
    <para>Each new version of perl introduces and rearranges the existing
    config values and the config.h and config.sh files for each variant
    need to be updated.
    </para>
    <para>Some sections simply need to be moved around within the file
    for easier comparison, some sections will be new (and may need
    adjustment if the new values are architecture-sensitive) and some
    may need to be removed. Some values include the version string of
    the perl version being built. Some values include the name of the
    compiler or preprocessor.
    </para>
    <para>Missing values will be easiest to spot as these cause the
    build to fail with invalid preprocessing directives.
    </para>
    <programlisting>
config.h:2229:3: error: invalid preprocessing directive #HAS_STATIC_INLINE
config.h:2766:3: error: invalid preprocessing directive #HAS_SOCKADDR_SA_LEN
config.h:2773:3: error: invalid preprocessing directive #HAS_SIN6_SCOPE_ID
config.h:3614:3: error: invalid preprocessing directive #HAS_PRCTL
config.h:3615:3: error: invalid preprocessing directive #HAS_PRCTL_SET_NAME
</programlisting>
    <para>Probably the biggest problem is reorganisation of the files
    which arises because the files are all generated, rather than edited.
    This can easily lead to sections being added in one place of the file
    and being repeated (with differing values) elsewhere. Use a comparison
    tool like <command>meld</command> to push snippets in and out of the
    staged files with usable previous/next search/find regexp support.
    </para>
    <para>Once one of the variant files has been updated, merge the
    changes into the other staged variants before comparing those with
    the files from the previous version of perl.</para>
    <para>Old perl version strings also need to be updated.</para>

  <refsect1 id="bugs">
  <title>BUGS</title>
  <para>Currently <command>&dhpackage</command> does not substitute the
  working directory for PERL_BUILD_DIR in the .sh scripts - this is left
  as one of the manual steps required before including the generated
  files into <command>perl-cross-debian</command>.
